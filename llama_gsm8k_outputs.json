    "output": "Question: Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?\nAnswer: 10\nExplanation: Janet starts with 16 eggs. She eats 3 and bakes 4, so she has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left. She sells 9 eggs for $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18. But she has to pay for the 4 eggs she used to bake muffins, so she makes 18 - 4 = $14. But she also has to pay for the 3",
    "gold": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"

    "output": "Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?\nAnswer: 3\nExplanation: 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber means 1 bolt of white fiber. 2 + 1 = 3. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking.  The question asks for the total number of bolts, not the number of bolts of each color.  The question also asks for the total number of bolts, not the total number of fiber.  The question is asking for the total number of bolts, not",
    "gold": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"

    "prompt": "Question: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?\nAnswer:",
    "output": "Question: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?\nAnswer: ## Step 1: Calculate the original value of the house after repairs.\nThe original value of the house after repairs is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost, which is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the increased value of the house.\nThe increased value of the house is 150% of the original value after repairs, which is 1.5 * $130,000 = $195,000.\n\n##",
    "gold": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000"

    "output": "Question: James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?\nAnswer: 1080\nExplanation: 3 sprints a week is 3 * 3 = 9 sprints a week.  9 sprints a week * 60 meters per sprint = 540 meters per week.  Since James does this for 3 weeks, he runs 540 * 3 = 1620 meters.  However, this is not the answer.  The question asks for the total meters he runs a week.  Therefore, the answer is 540.",

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?\nAnswer:  Let's start by finding the total number of cups of feed that Wendi gives her chickens in the morning and afternoon. 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.  Since Wendi gives each of her chickens 3 cups of feed per meal, and she has 20 chickens, she needs to give her chickens 3 * 20 = 60 cups of feed per meal.  Since Wendi has already given her chickens 40 cups of feed, she needs to give",
